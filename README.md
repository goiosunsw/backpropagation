# Backpropagation

Folder includes:

* Example jupyter notebooks:
  
  * [Synchronised Backpropagation.ipynb][Synchronised Backpropagation.ipynb] exemplifying how to adjust a fit of the vocal tract using data from the recording
  * [Async Backpropagation.ipynb][Async Backpropagation.ipynb] exemplifying how to do backpropagation using a vocal tract measurement fitted prior to the analysis. Fitted data can be generated with [Synchronised Backpropagation.ipynb][Synchronised Backpropagation.ipynb]
